This app is designed to challenge the user to defeat randomly selected opponents on Chess.com.
It uses Chess.com's API, Flask, PostgresQL, SQLAlchemy, and WTForms to create a database of users and opponents.
Users will be presented with 6 challenges each day, and once those opponents are defeated, the information will be stored to show to the user later
