This app is designed to challenge the user to defeat randomly selected opponents on Chess.com.
It uses Chess.com's API, Flask, PostgresQL, SQLAlchemy, and WTForms to create a database of users and opponents.
Users will be presented with 6 challenges each day, and once those opponents are defeated, the information will be stored to show to the user later

If this site is being hosted, the link will be present here:



Planned Updates:

*Improve css to make better use of homepage space
*Clean up code in certain functions to remove redundancy or clutter
